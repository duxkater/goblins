# Conversation

The game takes the form of a conversation between everyone around the table. One person will take on the role of GM, whose job is to frame the conversation, describe the world in which the goblins live, and how that world reacts to their actions.

Players describe how their goblins act, what they think, and how they feel.
# Characteristics

To represent your goblin's strengths and weaknesses, the game uses characteristics ranging from -3 to +3. These are assigned when the goblin is created and can change over time.

- **Hit:** when your goblin fights, uses force to push, pull, hold back, etc.
- **Run:** when your goblin has to run, flee, or think quickly
- **Avoid:** when your goblin has to infiltrate, spy, hide something, etc.
- **Observe:** when your goblin searches a place, watches someone, looks for something...
- **Influence:** when your goblin tries to intimidate, lie, or persuade...
# Advancement

Your goblin evolves over the course of raids, becoming more and more experienced. To represent this, each time you fail an action roll, you can check off 1 XP. After 6 XP, you can check off an advancement and clear your XP total.

When you have checked off all your advancements, it is time for your goblin to retire. You can create a new one or choose another goblin from the clan.
# Conditions

Conditions represent your goblin's physical state. They usually occur during combat or particularly dangerous actions.

When your goblin receives a condition, mark it next to one of your characteristics that does not yet have one. Choose a very short description of this condition (*cut, blow to the head, fall, etc.*).

All rolls with this characteristic will be made with a -1 penalty until the condition disappears.

If all of your goblin's characteristics are marked with a condition, it is too exhausted to continue fighting and must retreat until the next short phase (consultation phase or victory phase).
# Counters

A counter is a simple way to represent a growing threat, the passage of time, or dwindling resources. It can be represented by a bar with a number of checkboxes. For example, here is a size 6 counter:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

A counter always starts at zero, and when it is filled, something important usually happens. It is the GM's responsibility to manage counters, but they must be visible to players at all times.
# Rolling the dice

When an action requires it, the GM will ask you to roll the dice. Rolls are always made with two six-sided dice, to which one of your goblin's characteristics is usually added.

For example, rolling 2d6+charge means adding the result of the two dice to your charge characteristic.

The result tells you your level of success:

- **On a 10 or higher**, it's a success: you achieve your goal without any downside.
- **Between 7 and 9** is a partial success: you achieve your goal, but something doesn't go as planned, you have a price to pay, a difficult choice to make.
- **6 or less** is a failure. The GM describes how events take a turn for the worse.
# Actions

When what a player describes triggers an action, the conversation stops while the group follows what it says to do. It's like a little rule that comes between the conversation, and only when the fiction triggers it. Once the action is complete, the conversation resumes.
### Field Action

When a player goblin does something risky or with an uncertain outcome, they roll 2d6 + the appropriate attribute.

- On 10+: the action is successful. The player goblin describes what happens.
- On 7-9: the action is successful, but there is a complication. The GM describes what happens.
### Scouting Action

When a goblin player searches for clues in the surrounding area during the scouting phase, they roll 2d6 + the appropriate attribute.

- On 10+: they find a clue. The GM will describe it to them.
- On 7-9: they find a clue, but the GM also describes a complication.
### Diversion Action

When a player goblin tries to make others forget they are there after being spotted during the scouting phase, they roll 2d6 + Dodge.

- On 7+, his pursuers lose track of him.
- On 10+, he finds a clue.
### Search Action

When a player goblin searches a location for loot during the raid phase, he rolls 2d6 + Observe.

- On a 10+: he finds something interesting. The GM describes his find to him. He adds 3 to the clan's wealth counter.
- On a 7-9: He finds something of little value. The GM describes his find to him. He adds 1 to the clan's wealth counter. In addition, he chooses 1 of the following:
	- cost
	- danger
	- suspicion
## Inventory Action

When a goblin player takes an item out of their bag to use it for an action, they remove 1 clan token and announce the item to the group. They gain +1 to follow.
