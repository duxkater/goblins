# Sorcerer

You found this shiny rock and decided to embed it in your forehead. Since then, you've felt ancient magic flowing through you. Choose one element from among water, fire, lightning, acid, or rust, or decide on an element with the GM. When you attempt to use your magic in accordance with your element, roll 2D6 + Strike.

On a 10+, everything goes as planned.

On a 7-9, choose 1:

- You are at odds with your element. You will have to perform a ritual during the next short phase.
- The god of your element seems unhappy. You will have to appease him.
- Your spell works a little better than expected and causes a catastrophe. Describe it.
- Your talent for magic attracts unwanted attention.
# Smart

You've always been a little smarter than your peers. You can read and write the human dialect and another language of your choice. What's more, when you help answer the question “How are we going to attack this place?”, you can ask the GM for a clue that wasn't discovered during the reconnaissance phase. If all the clues have been discovered, choose one clue that can be used twice.
# Muscular

You are strong, very strong. In fact, you are much more muscular than your clanmates. You gain +1 to Strike. You can also use human weapons and armor.
# Secret

You have a natural talent for blending into the background, slipping into the shadows, and finding passages where others cannot see them. When you attempt to infiltrate a location, roll 2D6 + Dodge.

On a 10+, ask 2 questions.

On a 7-9, ask 1 question.

- How can I achieve my goal without being spotted?
- What should I watch out for here?
- What could go wrong?
- Where are the exits in case of disaster?
## Strategist

People listen to you when you speak, that's just how it is. You're not stronger or smarter, but your opinion matters more than others'. When you give an order to an NPC goblin, they obey you. Once per assault phase, you can modify a clue to use it differently.
## Cook

You know how to transform any ingredient that others would find repulsive. In fact, no one dares ask you what's in your pot anymore. Once per session, describe the meal you are preparing. It will make you and your clan stronger and more alert. Once per session, each goblin PC who has eaten your food can reroll a failed die roll.
## Animal Trainer

Others don't understand your bond with animals. Why eat a horse when it can be useful in so many ways? Choose an animal. Once per session, you can choose to perform an action with the help of your animal. Describe how it helps you. This roll is automatically successful.
## Clairvoyant

Since birth, you have had visions of the afterlife. Spirits speak to you, and you consult them when you need to. The first time you discover a clue during a session, the spirits immediately point out a second one nearby.
## Death Spit

Your breath is a unique mixture of rotten mushrooms and poisonous herbs. Once per session, you can blow a cloud of unbearable miasma that forces a target to flee, faint, or vomit.
