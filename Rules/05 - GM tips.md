Just as player goblins trigger actions during conversation, the GM has their own actions aimed at making the conversation flow smoothly, exciting to play, and full of suspense.

There are three tools to help them in this task:

- Objectives: these set the tone for the game and define what the game will be about.
- Principles: short guidelines that frame the GM's decisions in order to stay true to the objectives.
- GM actions: these are used to move the story forward while respecting the principles.
# Objectives

There are three objectives, and they should guide you in all your decisions:

- Describe a warm and welcoming world from which goblins are excluded.
- Give the world a fantastical feel.
- Play around with how the clan influences the world.

**Describe a warm and welcoming world from which goblins are excluded.* *

The cities that the goblins will attack are full of life, resources, and people who rely on each other. You must make the players feel that the clan is excluded from these circles, and that the cities are prepared to use force to preserve their way of life and eradicate the goblins. They are a nuisance to humans.

**Give the world a fantastical tone.**

The world in which the game takes place is one of magic, elves, dwarves, dark pacts with demons, and shamans sitting by the fire, eyes rolled back, explaining their visions in hoarse voices.

**Play to see how the clan influences the world.**

The clan must survive in this hostile world. And its actions will have an impact on the world, on the sometimes delicate balance between factions, on periods of abundance or attrition in towns and villages.
# Principles

- Ask questions, use the answers.
- Act according to the fiction.
- Begin and end with the fiction.
- Be a fan of the characters.
- Immerse yourself in the fantasy.
- Address the characters, not the players.
- Don't name your actions.
- Think “danger.”

# Actions

GM actions are triggered in three cases:
- When a player rolls a 6- on a die roll.
- When an opportunity arises.
- When the players are waiting for you to tell them what will happen.

Here is a list of GM actions:

- Show signs of an impending threat.
- Reveal an unwanted truth.
- Bring in the clan curse.
- Tell the PCs the conditions or consequences of their actions.
- Offer the PCs an opportunity, with or without a cost.
- Put a goblin comrade in danger.
- Deplete the PCs' resources.
- Put someone in a difficult situation.
- Turn the PCs' actions against them.
- Separate the PCs.
- Inflict damage.
# City sheets

The GM's main job is to keep the conversation flowing while staying on track with their objectives. The content of the conversation will be dictated by **the city sheets**.

A city sheet contains all the information the GM needs to run a game.

It includes:

- **the name of the city**
- a blank space to enter **the faction** to which it belongs.
- **Its size**, which is used to determine the size of the tracking counter, as well as to give an approximate idea of the type of place the players want to attack (a hamlet, a city, a capital, etc.).
- **Several impressions** to be used from time to time to give the goblin players an idea of the atmosphere of the city and add color to the descriptions.
- **Clues**, presented in list form. Each clue can be revealed to the group when an action requires it (usually the scouting action).
# Leading the reconnaissance phase

The reconnaissance phase plays out like a classic role-playing game. Players describe their character's behavior, and you describe how the world around them reacts.

However, keep in mind that this is an infiltration phase, which should be full of suspense and danger. The goblin players are not at home, and they must feel it. The inhabitants of the cities flee from them, raise the alarm, or even take up the nearest makeshift weapon to get rid of them.

Check off the clues that the players discover as they go along without worrying too much about what they will do with them. That's their problem.
# Leading the raid phase

During this phase, which is also played like a classic role-playing game, keep in mind that the level of chaos and alert in the city increases with the raid counter.

The start of this phase should come as a surprise to the city's inhabitants. They are caught off guard and probably overwhelmed by events. Then, as the counter increases, the inhabitants recover, organize themselves, equip themselves, and things become complicated for the goblins.

It is during this phase that players will have the opportunity to unlock the advantages of each city, but only if they use the related clue and the fiction allows it.
