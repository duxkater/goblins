Each game follows a fixed structure consisting of five phases, which you will play one after the other.

These phases are as follows:

- Rest phase
- Scouting phase
- Consultation phase
- Raid phase
- Victory phase

Some phases are shorter than others, but all are important.
# Rest Phase

*(short phase)*

The rest phase is a time when goblins brag, squabble, and proudly show off their latest treasure.

During this phase, follow these steps in order:

- The group chooses the next town to target.
- Each goblin player can remove one condition.
- The GM creates the detection counter. It has the same value as the size of the targeted city minus the alert level of the faction that owns the city, with a minimum of 0.
	*For example: for a size 4 city with a faction on alert level 2, the detection counter will be 4 - 2 = 2.*
- The clan can spend 1 wealth to increase the tracking counter by 1 point *(The goblins may have bribed guards, greased the palm of a watchman, etc.)* as many times as they wish, within the limits of the clan's wealth points.
- The clan spends 1 food for each goblin player participating in the upcoming assault. A goblin who cannot feed will have a continuous -1 penalty on all rolls until the next victory phase.
## Reconnaissance Phase

*(long phase)*

During this phase, the player goblins are sent alone to the city they have chosen to attack. This is a “classic” role-playing phase where the GM and players converse, aided by the rules.

During their infiltration, the player goblins must find clues that will help them carry out their upcoming raid without being spotted.

**Failed actions and mistakes in the fiction increase the detection counter by 1 each time.**

When the counter reaches zero, the goblins must retreat, more or less hastily. Their mischief has been noticed by the authorities and they are now wanted.

Certain actions can reduce the counter (e.g., creating a diversion, eliminating a lookout). If a player believes that their action is likely to lower the counter, they mention it to the GM, who may or may not accept it.
# Consultation phase

*(short phase)*

The consultation phase is when the goblin players must answer the following question:

**How are we going to attack this place?**

This is the moment when everything is decided: are the goblin players clever enough to take advantage of their discoveries, or will they rush headlong into disaster?

To answer this question, they have at their disposal all the clues gathered during the reconnaissance phase. They don't have to use all of them, but the more they use, the easier the next phase will be.

They can also ask an elder of the clan for advice, if they have a connection to one. The elder can provide them with an additional clue that hasn't been discovered, or invent a clue inspired by the spirits (at the GM's discretion).

Players also have the option of spending 1 loot point from their clan to obtain an additional clue. They probably bribed a careless guard.

The GM then creates a raid counter, whose value is equal to the number of clues used.

Once the plan has been established and the clues used have been checked off, it's time to move on to the attack.
# Raid Phase

*(long phase)*

The goblin players have alerted the clan and informed everyone of the plan. It's time to descend on the city and loot as much wealth as possible.

This is also a classic role-playing phase, where conversation, alongside the rules, drives the fiction.

During this phase, every action that involves the use of an item is rolled with a +1 bonus. Each item can only be used once.

During this phase, every action that involves a clue in any way is rolled with a +1 bonus. Each clue can only be used once.

**When a goblin player uses a clue, the raid counter advances by 1.**

The more the raid counter fills up, the more the city reacts: panic spreads, defenders organize, reinforcements arrive...

When the raid counter reaches its end, the assault is over, the troops are exhausted, the city recovers, and it's time to decamp.
# Victory Phase

(short phase)

During this phase, the goblins savor their victory and count their gains.

Each goblin transfers the total from their loot counter to the clan's counter.

The GM modifies the faction counters (they increase the counter of the faction to which the city that has just been pillaged belongs by 1, and decrease another counter of their choice by 1 as well).

At this point, players can choose to consume loot units to add the same amount in food or supplies.
