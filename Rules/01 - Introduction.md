GOBLINS is a role-playing game where you play goblins, members of the same clan, seeking to survive and prosper by raiding the surrounding human, dwarf, and elf villages and fortresses. Cunning, chaotic, and often underestimated, you infiltrate cities, steal anything that glitters, and sow panic before returning to the shadows. This way of life dooms the clan to a grim fate, as it infuriates the leaders of the factions victimized by these raids.
# The clan

The clan is more than thirty goblins squabbling after a meager meal by the fire; it's a family. It's more than a band of raiders; it's a haven of camaraderie in a world where no one likes greenskins. This life of raids and pillaging is forced upon you, and the only respite this cruel world, seemingly designed for others, offers is an evening playing knucklebones and drinking mushroom cider with your comrades.

Without the clan, you're nothing more than a miserable goblin at the mercy of the first guard who comes along.
# The player goblins

The term “player goblins” refers to the characters portrayed by the people around the table (excluding the Game Master).

These are the elite members of the clan, the most cunning, the strongest, or the most sensitive to magical winds. They are the ones sent on reconnaissance missions, and they are the ones who lead the charge.
**They are respected within the clan.**
# Factions

The locations targeted by player-goblins and their clans belong to factions, which are created at the start of the campaign. These factions, in addition to possessing villages, cultures, and leaders, also have relationships with each other that can be hostile.
# Cities

Let's be clear: we're talking about a cluster of dwellings, sometimes human, sometimes elven, and more rarely dwarven, regardless of its size.

As long as there are riches to plunder, food to steal, and equipment to salvage, even the most wretched hamlet is a town. A target for the clan. Whether that town is the village of Fort-aux-Oies or the sun-city of Saro-thaan.
# How the game works

The game is based on a conversation between players, who together build the narrative of their raids and the survival of their clan. One person will take on the role of Game Master (GM), responsible for bringing the world to life, posing challenges, and reacting to the goblins' actions.
# What you will need to play:

- Six-sided dice
- One character sheet per player
- The clan sheet
- City sheets corresponding to the raided locations

The game follows a structured cycle of five phases, each played in order.

1. Rest Phase – The clan recovers after a raid.
2. Reconnaissance Phase – The goblins infiltrate the city to gather clues.
3. Planning Phase – They plan the attack, using their findings.
4. Raid Phase – The clan goes into action, sowing chaos and destruction.
5. Victory Phase – The consequences of the raid on the clan and the world are assessed.

Each cycle represents a raid against a city.
These phases are explained in detail in the “Game Phases” section.
