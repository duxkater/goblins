Before you start playing, you need to complete a few steps that will help you create a coherent and interesting setting. This includes the region where your game will take place, as well as the clan and the goblins that make it up.
# Create the region

Take a large sheet of paper and take turns placing topographical features in places that seem logical to you. Cities, rivers, coastlines, mountains... Let your imagination run wild.
The map doesn't need to be very detailed; a simple sketch will suffice.
When you are satisfied with the result, move on to the next step.

Each player, including the GM, creates a surrounding faction, draws its outline on the map, gives it a name, and briefly describes it. Who leads it? What is the local specialty? How does it get along with neighboring factions?

For example, here is an example of a faction:

*The Duchy of Montrevault*
- *Led by Duke Richard of Montrevault, a belligerent opportunist.*
- *Good quality iron is mined there, and its carrot stew is renowned.*
- *The duke has his sights set on the neighboring county and is waiting for an opportunity to seize it.*

For each faction, the GM creates a corresponding counter with 6 segments. It starts at zero. This counter represents the faction's attention to the goblin clan. The more the counter is filled, the more seriously the faction takes the goblin threat and deploys resources to get rid of it.

Once everyone has created a faction, it's time to create the clan.
# Create the clan

The clan is a central element of GOBLINS. It has its own sheet, where players can see important information about it, its progress, and areas for improvement.
Start by giving it a name. If you're stuck for inspiration, roll 2D12 and take inspiration from the following random tables.

| 1 - Dark       | 1 - Fang     |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| 2 - Gloomy     | 2 - Moon     |
| 3 - Claw       | 3 - Guts     |
| 4 - Blood      | 4 - Jaw      |
| 5 - Breeze     | 5 - Howler   |
| 6 - Rust       | 6 - Maw      |
| 7 - Fang       | 7 - mire     |
| 8 - Chew       | 8 - blood    |
| 9 - Ash        | 9 - skeleton |
| 10 - Venom     | 10 - shadow  |
| 11 - Stink     | 11 - guts    |
| 12 - Grumbling | 12 - Clan    |

Once this is done, take a few minutes to discuss the clan's history by answering these questions:

- Which legendary goblin created it?
- Why is the clan located in this region?
- How did the clan survive until now?
- What legends do the shamans tell in the evening while devouring their roasted beetles?
- What prompted the clan to become nomadic?

Finally, draw a curse from the following random table that has plagued the clan for decades. Perhaps it can be lifted one day? (The curses are described in a separate document.)
|                                      |
| ----------------------------- |
| 1 - Eternal Hunger |
| 2 - Cursed Blood |
| 3 - Iron Haunts Us |
| 4 - Shadow of the Great Eater |
| 5 - Blood of the Serpent People |
| 6 - Ashes of the Ancient Fire |

|                                 |
| ------------------------------- |
| 1 - Eternal Hunger              |
| 2 - Sang Maudit                 |
| 3 - Iron Haunts Us              |
| 4 - Shadow of the Great Eater   |
| 5 - Blood of the Serpent People |
| 6 - Ashes of the Ancient Fire   |
# Populate the clan

Goblins aren't just anonymous looters; they're part of a clan, a dysfunctional but endearing family. To reinforce this bond, each PC will be associated with two important goblins who matter to them. To create a goblin companion, follow these steps:

- Choose a name for them. If you're stuck for inspiration, here are a few examples: *Grik-Grik, Bouillasse, Krass-Doigt, Momo-le-Fort, Zlab-Zlab, Ventracuit, Chiff'Oeil, Grok'Mâche, Zog-le-Sage*
- Choose an archetype from among:
	- The Protege: a younger or weaker goblin who relies on him. *“He's small, he's weak, and he relies on you. One day, he may become a real goblin... if he survives that long.”*
	
	- The Comrade: a goblin of the same age with whom he has a strong relationship (rivalry, friendship, admiration...). *“You grew up together, sharing blows and laughter. You are bound together... in one way or another.”*
	
	- The Elder: a wise or veteran goblin who gives them advice, real or fake. *“He has seen things. He claims to know secrets. He whispers truths... or nonsense.”*

These goblins aren't just there for decoration, they have a mechanical purpose:
- **The protégé:** Once per session, when an event threatens your protégé (a trap, a fight, a fire, etc.), you can decide to save them automatically by describing how. In return, they reveal a clue (during the scouting phase) or loot (during the raid phase).

- **The Comrade:** Once per session, if you describe how your comrade helps you in an action, describe how, and get a +1 bonus.

- **The Elder:** Before an assault or infiltration, the Elder can give you a “sign” or “advice” that only you can hear. Once per session, if you follow this advice, you gain +1 to a related action. But be careful, sometimes the Elders are senile or crazy...
# Create your goblins

Each goblin player is an elite member of the clan and plays a vital role. They are sent out on reconnaissance missions and are the first line of defense. They also all have a unique talent.

- **Choose a name**
- **Allocate your stats:** Assign each of these scores to one of your characteristics: -1, 0, 0, 1, 2
- **Choose a goblin action** (see: goblin actions sheet). No two members of the group can have the same talent.
- **Choose a lucky charm:** a small object that brings you luck (for example: a tooth from your favorite old worg, a clay pipe stolen from Grom the Foolish, etc.). Where did you get it? What is it used for? Once per raid phase, you can describe how the lucky charm helps you perform an action and gain a +1 bonus on that action.
- Your goblin has a major flaw. **What is it?**

**Once these steps are complete, you can start playing.**
