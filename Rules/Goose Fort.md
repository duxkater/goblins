# Places :
- **The village square**: A small round square with paved ground, a hundred-year-old tree in the center, and a small market organized around it. Lots of coming and going.
- **The surrounding wall**: An old stone wall, worn in places. Wooden watchtowers, each occupied by watchmen.
- **The alarm bell**: At the top of a 2-meter-high wooden structure. It is cracked.
- **The temple**: A stone building decorated with purple hangings. Incense smoke rises from the windows.
- **The tavern**: A wooden tavern at the entrance to the town. Laughter can be heard coming from inside. There is a stable in front.
# Clues
- A member of the temple exits through a hidden door, hastily hiding the key under a rock.
- The portcullis appears to be made of worm-eaten, worn wood.
- The surrounding wall is abandoned in places. Entire sections have collapsed.
- The village chief hides an old grimoire behind his fireplace (unlocks the **Forbidden Tome** perk).
- The village geese are not normal: they watch and report what they see (unlocks the **Trained Goose Farm** perk).
- A strange glow emanates from the tavern cellar.
- The villagers are afraid to say certain words, as if they were cursed.
- Some villagers seem to enter and leave the temple very regularly (unlocks **Truth Serum**).
- An old blind woman asks passersby for money.

- Several bottles of alcohol hidden in the brambles near a watchtower.
- A gold coin in the mud in front of a temple wall.
# Unlockable perks:

- **Forbidden tome**: Sometimes allows you to summon a small earth golem. Be careful not to forget any words.
- **Serum of truth**: A vial of golden liquid. Once per scouting phase, force an NPC who drinks it to reveal a clue to you.
- **Flock of trained geese**: The goblins capture a few geese from the village. Once per session, they can be used as a diversion.
# Twist (GM only):

The inhabitants of Fort-aux-oies are secretly worshippers of Zuul, the demon of a thousand words. Every night, they gather in the basement to pray and exchange forbidden secrets. If their cult is threatened, they will stop at nothing to protect their knowledge...
